DESCRIPTION:

Re-scale of the original compilation made by Appletun's Apples for v19 of Pokémon Essentials,
now available for v20 and v20.1. You can copy the content of both folders on the same path
inside the main Pokémon essentials project, which is the following:

Graphics -> Pokémon -> Eggs

To test it, use the debug option while selecting a Pokémon in your party and use the "Set egg" option.

CREDITS:

Credit for the eggs main sprites go to the Pokémon Reborn and Rejuvenation team,
the original compilation and renaming was made by user Appletun's Apples and the
icons of the eggs were made by me, LilMicolash

The Phione Egg main sprite and icon are the same as Manaphy, so credit to Game Freak for those ones
